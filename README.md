A CYOA style games engine in HTML/JS/CSS.

It models the game as an array of JSONs with numerical keys for each state (ideally behaving like IDs), which would be like the pages in a Choose Your Own Adventure Novel.
It has a basic User Interface for navigating the game, offering choices from a list for each given state, which the user can click to be directed to new states. A state with no choices would be an ending. 
A small example 'game' is provided in the source code, though it would be good practice to write the game separately or, even better, write a program that generates the game's JSONs.
